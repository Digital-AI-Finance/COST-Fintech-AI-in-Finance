Letter of Support: COST Innovators Grant (CIG) Application 
VisionXAI: Pioneering Visual Analytics for Establishing XAI Standards in European Finance with a 
Policy-Focused Impact 
Coimbra, May 11th 2024 
Dear Members of the CIG Committee, 
University of Coimbra Institute for Legal Research (UCILeR) is the research unit of the Faculty of 
Law. Fully aware of its tradition, contributing to the production and dissemination of legal knowledge 
in the last few centuries, it is UCILeR's purpose to steer our research to contemporary expectations 
and quality standards. UCILeR is proud of its past, and driven to meet the highest standards of 
excellence in its future activity. In recent years, UCILeR has increased its participation in funded 
international projects, and it considers internationalisation and research excellence as a key vector. 
As a legal research organization, the Institute research is dedicated to the new challenges posed by 
the interaction between societal changes and contemporary policies. The challenges imposed by 
technical society are one of the main research topics focusing on cutting-edge themes, such as 
robotics, artificial intelligence and techlaw. A new line of research is directly devoted to the legal 
challenges posed by Artificial Intelligence, a topic on which the UCILer has several publications, 
scientific meetings and ongoing projects.  
We are aware of the application submitted by Prof. Dr. Jörg Osterrieder from Bern Business School 
for the COST Innovator Grant with the title “VisionXAI: Pioneering Visual Analytics for 
Establishing XAI Standards in European Finance with a Policy-Focused Impact”, which aligns with 
our research goals and current activities. The legal challenges and duties impose by the new regulation 
(AI ACT) demand for transparency and robustness of AI systems.  VisionXAI seeks to create a visual 
analytics tool that enhances the interpretability and standards of XAI in the European financial sector, 
meeting regulatory requirements, topic which is of great interest to the UCILER.  
With this letter, we confirm that we are very interested in the proposed solution, and we look forward 
to assessing the results of the project relevant for our research activities. 
Sincerely,
