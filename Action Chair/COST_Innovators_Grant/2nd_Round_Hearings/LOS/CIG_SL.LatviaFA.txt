Subject: Letter of Support for COST Innovators Grant (CIG) Proposal: "VisionXAI: 
Pioneering Visual Analytics for Establishing XAI Standards in European Finance with 
a Policy-Focused Impact"
The Finance Latvia Association (FLA) is pleased to submit a letter of support for the 
COST Innovators Grant (CIG) proposal "VisionXAI: Pioneering Visual Analytics for 
Establishing XAI Standards in European Finance with a Policy-Focused Impact."
The FLA, representing a broad spectrum of financial institutions and market 
participants in Latvia, actively champions innovation and responsible development 
within the Latvian financial sector.
The burgeoning use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in finance presents exciting 
opportunities alongside crucial considerations. The growing recognition of the need 
for explainable AI (XAI) underscores its importance in fostering transparency and 
trust in AI-powered financial services.
We view VisionXAI's proposal as a highly valuable contribution to the critical effort 
of developing XAI standards in European finance. Their focus on regulatory 
compliance aligns perfectly with the sector's pressing need for AI applications that 
adhere to existing financial regulations.
Furthermore, the development of XAI standards has the potential to significantly 
facilitate the implementation of responsible AI use cases in the financial sector. 
This would not only benefit the industry but also provide a clear framework for 
effective regulatory oversight.
The FLA is confident that VisionXAI's research holds great promise for the European 
financial landscape. We strongly encourage the CIG committee to give their 
proposal thorough consideration.
Sincerely,
Sanita Bajāre
CEO
