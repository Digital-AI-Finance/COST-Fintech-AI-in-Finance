Letter of support for COST Innovators Grant (CIG): “VisionXAI: Pioneering Visual analytics for  
Establishing XAI Standards in European Finance with a Policy-Focused Impact” 
Dear members of the CIG committee, 
On behalf of Cardo AI, I am writing to express our support for the VisionXAI project, 
"Pioneering Visual Analytics for Establishing XAI Standards in European Finance with a 
Policy-Focused Impact." As a leading disruptor and provider of data-driven investment 
management solutions, Cardo AI recognizes the critical need for increased transparency and 
trust in artificial intelligence (AI) models, particularly in the European financial sector.
The VisionXAI project promises to address the challenges of explainable AI (XAI) by 
developing a comprehensive visual analytics tool tailored to the specific needs of financial 
institutions, regulators, and end-users. This initiative aligns with Cardo AI’s commitment to 
responsible AI and data ethics. We believe that the project's focus on policy implications 
and regulatory compliance will make VisionXAI a valuable tool for enhancing transparency 
and accountability in our industry.
VisionXAI’s objectives to bridge the gap in explainable AI, making it accessible and 
understandable across various stakeholders, directly complement our efforts to foster trust 
and reliability in financial AI applications. Furthermore, the regulatory compliance aspect of 
VisionXAI will be instrumental in navigating the complex landscape of EU financial 
regulations. As these standards evolve, having a tool that ensures adherence while offering 
clear visual interpretations of AI decisions will be invaluable in maintaining and expanding 
our market presence across Europe.
By supporting this project, Cardo AI anticipates not only a mutual technological 
advancement, but also an opportunity to co-develop industry standards for XAI. This 
collaboration will enable us to share expertise, leverage groundbreaking research, and 
ultimately deliver enhanced value to our clients and stakeholders.
Sincerely, 
Altin Kadareja
