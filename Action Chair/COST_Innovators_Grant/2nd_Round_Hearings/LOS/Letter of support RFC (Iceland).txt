Subject: Letter of Support for "VisionXAI: Pio.neering Visual Analytics for Establishing XAI 
Standards in European Financen 
Dear Me!"Tlbers of the CIG Committee, 
The Reykjavik Fintech Cluster is pleased to endorse the VisionXAI project submitted under 
the COST action CA19130 - CIG program. Recognizing the initiative's transformative 
potential, we believe it will catalyze the adoption of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI} to 
enhance transparency and innovation across the European financial landscape, which is also 
a goal that the CIG committee seeks. 
In the rapidly evolving finance domain, the deployment of Al technologies has escalated, 
highlighting a critical need for clarity and understanding in Al-driven systems. The opacity of 
current Al applications can significantly diminish trust among key stakeholders, including 
financial analysts, regulatory bodies, and the public. The VisionXAI project proposes an 
inhovative visual analytics tool that promises to demystify Al operations, making them more · 
accessible and understandable. This tool will facilitate regulatory 
compliance, empower analysts with deeper insights and promote a widespread 
understanding of Al decisions among all users. 
At the Reykjavik Fintech Cluster, we strongly· support ethical and responsible Al use 
principles. The VisionXAI project aligns with our commitment to these values by supporting 
pioneering, transparent Al solutions within the financial sector. We strongly advocate for 
the CIG committee's endorsement and support for this project, enabling it to advance and 
substantially benefit the financial industry throughout Europe. 
We sincerely appreciate the time and consideration you have giv_en to our support for this 
pivotal project. Thank you for your ongoing commitment to advancing innovative solutions 
in the financial sector. 
Sincerely, 
unnlaugur Jonsson 
CEO, Reykjavik Fintech Cluster
