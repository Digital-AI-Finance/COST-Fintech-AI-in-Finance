Analytics for Establishing XAI Standards in European Finance with a Policy-Focused Impact 
 
Dear Members of the COST Innovators Grant (CIG) Selection Committee, 
The Aragonese Development Institute (IAF), a public entity under the Department of Economy, 
Employment and Industry of the Government of Aragon, Spain, promotes socio-economic development, 
employment growth, and reduces regional disparities. As a regional development agency, it focuses on 
fostering entrepreneurship and supporting business ideas, ultimately aiming for the integrated 
development of Aragon. 
We are aware of the application for the COST Innovator Grant with the title "VisionXAI: Pioneering 
Visual Analytics for Establishing XAI Standards in European Finance with a Policy-Focused Impact," 
which aligns with our dedication to responsible and transparent business practices. 
On the project's aim and scope, we have been informed that: 
• VisionXAI seeks to create a visual analytics tool that enhances the interpretability and standards 
of XAI in the European financial sector. 
• The project is geared towards meeting regulatory requirements and policy impacts, ensuring 
alignment with EU directives. 
• It is designed to be a scalable solution that bridges the gap between technical XAI approaches 
and practical financial applications. 
• VisionXAI aims to foster trust and transparency in AI-driven financial decisions by offering clear, 
user-friendly interpretations. 
• The initiative also intends to address bias detection and mitigation within AI systems, promoting 
fairness and data integrity. 
Given the expertise and dedication of the project team, we are confident that VisionXAI has the 
potential to make significant strides in advancing XAI standards and promoting ethical AI practices 
across the European finance sector. The interdisciplinary nature of the project, bringing together experts 
from fields such as finance, artificial intelligence, and policy, further strengthens its potential for impact 
and innovation. 
We wholeheartedly endorse the COST Innovator Grant application for VisionXAI, recognizing the 
significant role such a tool will play in the financial sector. 
With this letter, we confirm that we are very interested in the proposed solution, and we look 
forward to assessing the results of the project revenant for our business activities. 
Sincerely,  
 
Daniel Rey Saura
