VisionXAI: Pioneering Visual Analytics for Establishing XAI Standards in 
European Finance with a Policy-Focused Impact 
 
 
Dear Members of the COST Innovators Grant (CIG) Selection Committee, 
 
The Aragon Institute of Technology (ITA) is a public Technological Center, dependent 
on the Department of Economy, Employment and Industry of the Government of 
Aragon, whose mission is to promote research, innovation and technological 
development in companies and promote the technological possibilities of this region, to 
develop new products and processes, with the purpose of boosting the competitiveness 
of Aragón. 
 
We are aware of the application for the COST Innovator Grant with the title "VisionXAI: 
Pioneering Visual Analytics for Establishing XAI Standards in European Finance with a 
Policy-Focused Impact".  
 
On the project's aim and scope, we have been informed that: 
• 
VisionXAI seeks to create a visual analytics tool that enhances the interpretability 
and standards of XAI in the European financial sector. 
• 
The project is geared towards meeting regulatory requirements and policy impacts, 
ensuring alignment with EU directives. 
• 
It is designed to be a scalable solution that bridges the gap between technical XAI 
approaches and practical financial applications. 
• 
VisionXAI aims to foster trust and transparency in AI-driven financial decisions by 
offering clear, user-friendly interpretations. 
• 
The initiative also intends to address bias detection and mitigation within AI 
systems, promoting fairness and data integrity. 
 
Given the expertise and dedication of the project team, we are confident that VisionXAI 
has the potential to make significant strides in advancing XAI standards and promoting 
ethical AI practices across the European finance sector.  
 
The VisionXAI project addresses a critical need for establishing standards in XAI within 
the finance industry, aligning with the European Union's objectives of promoting 
transparency, accountability, and ethical AI practices. By leveraging visual analytics 
techniques, the project aims to enhance the interpretability and trustworthiness of AI 
models used in financial decision-making processes. 
 
We wholeheartedly endorse the COST Innovator Grant application for VisionXAI, 
recognizing the significant role such a tool will play in the financial sector.  
With this letter, we confirm that we are very interested in the proposed solution, and we 
look forward to assessing the results of the project revenant for our business activities. 
 
 
Sincerely,
