Letter of Support: COST Innovators Grant (CIG) Application 
VisionXAI: Pioneering Visual Analytics for Establishing XAI Standards in European 
Finance with a Policy-Focused Impact 
 
 
Dear members of the CIG committee, 
I am writing to express our firm support for the VisionXAI project, which has been submitted 
under the COST action CA19130 – CIG program. As a leading fintech platform in Turkey's 
online banking products category, HangiKredi has been dedicated to serving its users since 
2006. We have witnessed firsthand the transformative potential of innovative technologies in 
enhancing financial services and empowering users to make informed decisions. 
 
VisionXAI holds significant promise in advancing the European financial sector by promoting 
explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) and establishing crucial standards for its responsible 
application. In an era where the demand for AI-driven solutions in financial decision-making 
processes is on the rise, the lack of transparency inherent in such systems poses a significant 
challenge. VisionXAI's proposed solutions offer a compelling pathway to address this 
challenge, enabling users of varying levels to comprehend the logic behind AI-generated 
outcomes and fostering trust among stakeholders. 
 
At HangiKredi, we are deeply committed to fostering ethical and responsible AI practices within 
the financial sector. We firmly believe that the VisionXAI project aligns with our organizational 
values and vision. Therefore, we wholeheartedly endorse this project and urge the CIG 
committee to consider it favorably. 
 
We are confident that VisionXAI has the potential to significantly contribute to the 
advancement of the European financial sector and the broader fintech ecosystem. By fostering 
transparency and accountability in AI applications, this project can pave the way for more 
responsible and trustworthy financial services. 
 
Thank you for considering our letter of support for the VisionXAI project. We look forward to 
witnessing its success and the positive impact it will have on the financial industry. 
Sincerely 
Furkan Korkmaz 
Head of Product & Digital
