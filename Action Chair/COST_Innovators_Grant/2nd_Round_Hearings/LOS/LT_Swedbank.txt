Letter of Support for VisionXAI: Pioneering Visual Analytics for Establishing XAI 
Standards in European Finance 
 
 
Dear members of the CIG committee, 
 
Swedbank, AB wishes to express strong support for the VisionXAI project, a Consortium 
application submitted under the COST action CA19130 – CIG program. We believe this project 
holds immense potential to boost the European financial sector by fostering explainable 
Artificial Intelligence (XAI) and establishing critical standards for its responsible use. 
 
The increasing reliance on AI in financial decision-making necessitates solutions to address the 
inherent opacity of these systems. This lack of transparency hinders trust among stakeholders, 
including financial analysts, regulators, and the general public. VisionXAI's proposed visual 
analytics tool is a compelling answer to this challenge. Regulators can ensure compliance with 
financial policies, analysts can gain deeper insights, and end-users can comprehend the rationale 
behind AI-driven results. This fosters trust and strengthens governance in the use of AI. 
 
Furthermore, VisionXAI's focus on policy integration throughout the development cycle – from 
data collection to model output – is particularly noteworthy. This standardized approach will 
enhance transparency, address bias, and optimize decision-making processes within the financial 
industry. We believe VisionXAI has the potential to become an essential component of AI-
driven finance, facilitating broader adoption across institutions, regulatory bodies, and 
individuals. 
 
Swedbank is committed to fostering innovative solutions that promote ethical and responsible AI 
practices within the financial sector. We firmly believe the VisionXAI project aligns with this 
commitment. We urge the CIG committee to view this project favorably and grant it the 
necessary support to move forward. 
 
Sincerely, 
 
 
Sincerely,
