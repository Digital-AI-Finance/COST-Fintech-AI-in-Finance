      "description": "This Training School will highlight to young researchers but also to others\ninterested in the topic, the challenges of Fintech and Artificial Intelligence in\nFinance and will discuss the latest findings on how to improve it, with a special\nfocus on extending this towards Digital Finance. The trainers will be mainly\nselected from the Action, across all working groups. Additional expertise will be\ninvited to discuss the future of Finance, related to Digital Finance. Using the MoU\nof this Action as a hands-on example, trainees will learn to understand both\nchallenges and solutions in this field, to learn most recent AI techniques and their\nshort-comings as well as recent applications. Financial support will be provided to\nPhD students, with priority to improve gender balance and for students from ITC\ncountries. Established researchers will have to use their own travel funds,\nespecially from non-ITC countries.

A position paper\nand roadmap on mitigating risks connected with the increased use of digital\nassets A dedicated website will make the presentations and results available.\nSubstantial transfer of knowledge from experienced researchers to PhD students\n(and vice versa). We expect a long-lasting effect on social interactions from this\nkind of event.

      "description": "The Training School in Advanced Statistical Modelling for Fintech, financial\ninclusion and inequality is offered by University of Naples Federico II and is hosted\nby the Laboratory for Statistical Data Analysis within the Department of Political\nScience, University of Naples Federico II in September 2023 (13, 14, 15). The\nSchool is designed for COST members, stakeholders, researchers, PhD students,\nand possibly brilliant MSc graduates / final-year students interested in Statistics,\nProbability, Computer Science, Applied Mathematics, and related areas.The\ntrainers have been selected from the Action, across all working groups. Among\nparticipants the school will aim at a 50% gender representation and include\nmembers from at least 5 different countries, including ITC members. Preliminary\navailability by Albania, Bulgaria, France, Greece, Italy, Ireland, Romania, Turkey,\nMacedonia. The aim of the Training School (TS) AFFINE is to establish a track of\nhigh level courses on advanced and cutting-edge topics in Statistics and\nProbability with application in FinTech and Artificial Intelligence area. Expertise\nand regulators will be invited to discuss the future of Finance, related to Digital\nFinance. Participants will learn to understand both the challenges and solutions in\nthis field, learn about numeracy related to the latest AI techniques, as well as the\nlatest applications. The School offers lectures delivered by internationally leading\nscholars, selected from the Action, across all working groups, on the specific\ndesignated topic, and supervised tutorials. During the school participants analyse\nthe results of a survey on ‘Knowledge and use of Fintech products’ administered\nas part of the CA19130 Action from September to December 2022 and discuss\nthem also with end-user organisations. One of the objectives is to analyse data\nand assess the presence of diversity and inclusion in the fintech area through\nappropriate statistical models. Financial support will be provided to PhD and MSc\ngraduates / final-year students, with priority to improve gender balance and for\nstudents from ITC countries. Established researchers with their own travel funds\ncan join the Training School without reimbursement by the Action. Training school\nfor researchers, PhDs and Master students. We will invite trainers and\nparticipants. 3 workshops delivered by internationally leading scholars (3h each)\non a dedicated topic with implementations in our COST Action area will be given.\nTwo Lab sessions (3h each) show how to repeat the results presented in the\ntheoretical sessions through the use of open source software. One afternoon is\ndedicated to special training on transferable skills. One afternoon for social\nnetworking. A welcome event with a poster session where participants may show\ntheir research activity will also be provided. The event allows an exchange of\ninformation on activities even by those who are not currently part of the action.\nLast day is also dedicated to receive input from regulators (Bank of Italy) and\npractitioners' communities and to validate results with regard to increasing\ntransparency of artificial intelligence and Fintech applications (obj 3; 15 - overall\nobjectives). All payment is conditional on trainers to come from at least 5 different\nCOST countries, that contribute at least 60%, with each country at most 20%.\nTravel reimbursement is restricted to COST members with significant contributions\nto the meeting or the Action.\n21\n\n============================================================\nPAGE 22\n============================================================",
      "topics": "To introduce participants to statistical models for analysing complex data\nstructures from large-scale surveys consisting of multiple-choice items. Present\nparametric and non-parametric frameworks, joint methods for dimension reduction\nand clustering, statistical learning for fintech data science, data integration, data\npre-processing and data fusion enhancing participants' understanding. A\ndiscussion paper for possible approaches to building a statistically valid back-\ntesting framework is one of the deliverables (see point 5 GP3 - Overall\ndeliverables). Methodological discussion papers on AI models to generate “failed\ntrials” of investment product producers and on quantitative strategies with the\nusage of the promising field of network data analysis exchanges and regional\nconsolidation platforms optimised for accessibility to all partners represent another\nAFFINE deliverable (see point 10 GP3 - Overall deliverables). Course slides and\nnew solutions from open-source software packages, also developed by\nparticipants, will be available on the Action website. Key software (codes,\npackages) in line with WG objectives will be developed (see point 12 GP3 -\nOverall deliverables). The COST FinAI website will make the presentations and\nresults available. Substantial transfer of knowledge from experienced researchers\nto PhD/master students (and vice versa). We expect a long-lasting effect on social\ninteractions from this kind of event. Improved understanding of academic state-of-\nthe art in AI for Finance, training slides, presentation slides and new research\nchallenges for ML in Finance developed by participants available on the Action\nwebsite. Materials (slides, data, codes) about TS AFFINE will be updated on the\nAction website. Deliverable 5 and 10 will be done at the end of the event."
