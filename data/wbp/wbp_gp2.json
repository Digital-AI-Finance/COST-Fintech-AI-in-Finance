      "description": "https://www.meetup.com/Fintech_AI_in_Finance/events/283173624/ The co-\norganised conference “ML approaches Finance and Management” will be a two-\nday hybrid event. It provides a platform for interdisciplinary discussion on AI\napplication in finance, interpretable ML in management, statistics and\nexplainable AI, blended approaches in the FinTech domain, which is highly\nrelated to the COST Action FinAI. The conference will be recorded. The slides\nwill be available to all COST members. Moreover, the event is organised by\nfemale researchers, and female scientists will also present on the conference\n(meet GP2 the goal 6, Capacity Building 10). The conference will be recorded\nby video. (meet GP2 the goal 8). Keynote speakers include Prof. Giuseppe\nCavaliere (University of Bologna), Prof. Francis de Véricourt (ESMT Berlin),\nProf. Wolfgang Karl Härdle (Humboldt University of Berlin), Prof. Dennis\nKristensen (University College London) Prof. Olivier Scaillet (University of\nGeneva), Prof. Dacheng Xiu (University of Chicago). They will provide valuable\ninsight on the topic from multiple perspectives. It will help to create an excellent\nnetwork of researchers in Europe with lasting collaboration beyond the lifetime\nof the Action. (meet Capacity Building 1-9) There will be a dedicated COST\nFinAI Session: It will be from 14.45 to 17:45 on March 24th (3hours). Four\nspeakers will present here. Every presentation will last 45 minutes. Prof. Dr.\nWolfgang Härdle and I (1.75 hours) and Rui Ren are also from COST FinAI. So\nIn total we have at least six speakers from COST FinAI, and total time is 4.75\nhours. On March 25, 2022, we are also planning a working group meeting of\nworking group 1 after the end of the co-organised conference. Travel cost\nreimbursement is restricted to COST FinAI members.
