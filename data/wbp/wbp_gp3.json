One focus will be on the design of stress tests for the\nevaluation of AI and ML models under dynamic financial conditions to improve\nthe robustness of investment strategies. Time permitting, we will also discuss\nhow to design AI models to generate “failed trials” of investment product\nproducers and on quantitative strategies. The core group will meet to review the\nCOST FinAI Action so far and the plans going forward. This will serve as an\ninput to the annual MC meeting which will then take place in October.
